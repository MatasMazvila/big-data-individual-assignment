**Iowa Liquor Sales: EDA & Sales Forecasting**

This project analyzes historical liquor sales data from Iowa (2012â€“2017) through exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. The goal was to understand sales patterns and model weekly liquor volume sold per county.

We performed:

- Data cleaning and filtering on 12.6M records.

- EDA on store locations, monthly seasonality, and county-level trends.

- Sales prediction using a LightGBM regression model trained on features like bottle size, price, month, and county.

*To accelerate model training, parallel processing was enabled via n_jobs = -1 in LightGBM.*
